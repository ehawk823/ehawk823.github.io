Last week, I graduated from the Flatiron School, an immersive web development program in NYC. I spent 12 weeks there learning ruby, javascript, SQL, git, TDD and much more. The market for resources to learn to code has expanded dramatically over the past few years. There are a handful of similar bootcamps in NYC alone, as well as a multitude of sites offering programs to learn remotely.

The reasons for this influx are varied. Most notably, as tech moves further into the mainstream and word spreads of the generous salaries and comfortable lifestyle that technical skills can command, more and more people are eager to acquire the skills necessary for developer roles. Moreover, in recent years, the government has set in motion a range of initiatives offering grants and subsidies to organizations teaching students how to code. Just last March, the Obama administration made $100 million in grants available as part of their new TechHire initiative.

These factors have created a climate where the aspiring coder has a seemingly infinite variety of potential teachers. This spectrum can make the choice of selecting a course a daunting task. For this blog post, I'll specifically look at consideration for coding bootcamps, since to date this has been the part of the market with which I've had the most experience. I'm going to be increasingly dependent on online resources to learn subsequent languages moving forward, so perhaps I'll save those for another blog post.

With regard to these coding bootcamps, the main considerations for an aspiring programmer might be the program's cost, placement rates, prework, location and programming language.

Taking these items one-by-one, the majority of bootcamps range from $10k to $15k. There are a select few that will take a portion of your starting salary after the bootcamp rather than a flat fee at the outset.

With regard to placement rates, many camps boast placement rates above 90% within the first three months, but it's important to qualify those numbers. Many bootcamps factor in part-time employment and other arrangement to inflate these figures.

Programs also have varying amounts of pre-work, ranging from none at all to several hundred hours spread out over several weeks. It's important to look at the structure and duration of this pre-work to make sure it suits your needs, although generally speaking, the more time spent coding the better!

Location is also a major consideration. Is the bootcamp a reasonable commute from your home or might you need to move for the duration of the in-person portion of the program. Bootcamps will also likely have stronger connections with employers in their city, so where you want to live and work after the program is also a factor.

Finally the question of which programming language to learn is a difficult one. Looking at web development specifically, the majority of coding bootcamps teach Ruby. Ruby is a terrific language for learning to code, owing to its intuitive syntax and supportive community. That said, there are a handful of bootcamps that have begun teaching other languages, most notably full-stack javascript. While javascript may be more difficult to learn, one could argue that it is worthwhile to endure that struggle due to the language's increasing popularity and functionality across the stack.

The following site offers an even more detailed breakdown of many of the bootcamps options that are available -

I chose the Flatiron School primarily because of its stellar placement rates (which have been independently audited to confirm their validity). However, I found that beyond a strong placements team, the Flatiron school offered an extremely nurturing and collaborative environment, where people were genuinely excited to learn and to code. This is one quality that is difficult to discern from online metrics, and certainly a quality that I undervalued at the start of the program, but which proved to be invaluable in the long run. So as a last piece of advice, I'd recommend reading online reviews and maybe even visiting the bootcamps that you're considering. Try and get a feel for those intangibles that might just be more important than any claims of a six-figure starting salary.

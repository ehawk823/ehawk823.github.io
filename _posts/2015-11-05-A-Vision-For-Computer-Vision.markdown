For humans, vision is perhaps the most fundamental sense for interpreting and navigating the physical world. However for a long time, despite the capacity of computers to process and derive patterns from seemingly infinite data, our machines had lacked the ability to derive meaningful insights from visual inputs. This has been changing rapidly in recent years, and many of the applications for 'computer vision' have begun to make their way into the mainstream.

There are many different types of computer vision and how computer vision works is a robust topic, probably outside the scope of this blog post. The fundamental process requires a computer to break the pixels of a visual image down into bits of data and derive insights from how that data relates to data elsewhere in the image. Engineers have developed clever methods for discerning shapes, depth and movement, many of which are discussed by Dr. Mubarak Shah of UCF in the following lecture -

Moreover, computers have made significant strides in not only detecting objects and movement, but also classifying or identifying components of an image. In her TED talk on the subject, Fei Fei Li, head of #@$#@$@#$, offers some insight in on how machine learning and neural network can be implemented to inform the way that computers make educated decisions based on visual inputs -

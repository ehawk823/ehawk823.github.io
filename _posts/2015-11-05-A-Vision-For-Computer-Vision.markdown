For humans, vision is perhaps the most fundamental sense for interpreting and navigating the physical world. However for a long time, despite the capacity of computers to process and derive patterns from seemingly infinite data, our machines had lacked the ability to derive meaningful insights from visual inputs. This has been changing rapidly in recent years, and many of the applications for 'computer vision' have begun to make their way into the mainstream.

You may remember the Google Deep Dream meme from a few month back. The tool allowed you to run video or imagery through Google's image recognition algorithm, leading to an incredibly surreal output.

There are many different types of computer vision and how computer vision works is a robust topic, probably outside the scope of this blog post. The fundamental process requires a computer to break the pixels of an image down into bits of data and derive insights from how that data relates to data elsewhere in the image. Engineers have developed clever methods for discerning shapes, depth and movement, many of which are discussed by Dr. Mubarak Shah of UCF in the following lecture -

Computers have made significant strides in not only detecting objects and movement, but also classifying or identifying components of an image. In her TED talk on the subject, Dr. Fei Fei Li, Director of the Stanford AI Lab and Stanford Vision Lab, offers some insight into how machine learning and neural networks can be implemented to inform the way that computers make educated deductions based on visual inputs -

Hopefully these resources will give you a clearer picture of how computer vision functions. Now to consider the implications...

Computer vision tech has already been effectively utilized in numerous case studies. Satellites and air born military equipment have relied on computer vision to discern meaningful patterns (persons, objects, etc.) amidst large expanses of land. Security footage uses computer vision to detect threats or specific kinds of movement. Consider the smart car which relies on computer vision to effectively navigate and detect obstacles.

Computer vision has broad implications for a multitude of industries. Doctors can make more effective x-ray diagnoses with the help of computer vision. Advertisers can sift through vast quantities of streaming video to find the right candidates for their messaging. Facial image recognition can fight crime, take attendance, and much more.

Again these examples provide just a small glimpse of the technologies' potential, but they're worth considering all the same. Soon computers will grow even more intelligent and be able to discern complex emotions and previously unrecognizable subtleties within a given scene. Until that time, we'll just have to sit back and watch.

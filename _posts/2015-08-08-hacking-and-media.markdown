Exaggerated or entirely unrealistic depictions of hacking are rampant throughout television and film.

This point doesn't really require any evidence, but I've included a few examples below for entertainment value -

Pretty bad right? The good news is that depictions of hacking are gradually becoming more realistic as cyber security moves into the mainstream, especially in light of recent high-profile breaches - Target, Sony, etc. The typical filmgoer has become less tolerant of the sort of cheesy hacking sequences that predominated throughout the 80's and 90's.

Just in the past year, we've seen some of the most authentic depictions of hacking reach mainstream media.

Despite receiving mixed reviews, according to security expert Kevin Mahaffey, the recent blockbuster Blackhat (which I haven't seen), supposedly offers one of the most realistic depictions of hacking to ever grace the silver screen.

The film follows Nick Hathaway, a convicted hacker, who is released from prison to help track down a team of cyber criminals. While director Michael Mann certainly took a few creative liberties for dramatic purposes, he consulted with Kevin Poulsen (cyber security journalist and former hacker) and other experts to ensure that the film maintained its credibility.

Even more recently, the show Mr. Robot (which I have seen) debuted on USA. Mr Robot follows a vigilante hacker, Elliot, as he works to bring down a corrupt corporation. Besides providing consistent entertainment value, the show has been praised by for its accurate portrayal of hacking.

Series creater Sam Esmail hired a team of security engineers to consult. As a result, all code that appears on computer screens is legitimate as well as the processes that the protagonist uses to infiltrate various systems. Most of the hacks depicted in the show are based of real-life instances that Esmail's team researched heading into production.

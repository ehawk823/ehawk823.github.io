There are numerous ideas around the time required to master different skills. Through his 2008 book Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell popularized the idea that a person requires 10,000 hours to master a given skill. Although his assertions have been called into question since Outliers became a best seller, the idea of being able to approximate the hourly requirement to learn a given skill set is a compelling one.

I decided to look into this a bit more as it relates to programming languages. While I'm currently committed to learning Ruby, it isn't inconceivable that I might need to understand or become proficient in another language at some point in my career, so I thought this would be a good topic to look into.

I noticed that there were a number of studies conducted for spoken languages (see below) -

However, it was very difficult to find anything comparable for programming languages - aside from an abundance of too-good-to-be-true promotional pamphlets promising a mastery of C++ in under a week as well as a range of conflicting opinions on Quora, Yahoo Anwers, etc.

The best resource I found was a 2013 study from researchers at Berkley and Princeton focusing on the adoption of various languages, for which learning accessibility is an important criteria.

Combining this resource with information I was able to find on blogs, reddit and elsewhere, it seems pretty evident that C and C++ are some of the most difficult languages to master, while languages such a ruby, python and javascript are considerably more approachable.

I also looked into what programming languages are most similar, on the basis that learning languages comparable to ruby should be an easier undertaking than trying to take on ones that are completely different.

There were a number of interesting articles describing the similarities between languages, but the below was probably the most interesting because of how it visualized all the relevant data.

The good news is that even though ruby may have little in common with a language like C++ and may be relatively easier, as up and coming Rubyists we're still in a much better position to learn a second programming language than a complete beginner - regardless of its structural similarity or relative difficulty.
